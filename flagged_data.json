{"username": "Spencer B.", "message": "How do you make an egg whi", "response": "To make an egg white, you will need to separate the egg yolk from the egg white. You can do this by cracking the egg open on a flat surface, then carefully separating the shell halves and allowing the egg white to drip into a bowl. You can also use an egg separator if you have one available. Once you have the egg white separated, you can use it in a variety of recipes or consume it as is. It is important to note that egg whites should be cooked before consumption to ensure food safety."}
